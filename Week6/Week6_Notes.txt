    Usecases:
        1. Web -> Bearer token -> Use the token for auth for API -> Use the token for 
            next set of API calls
    
        2. Web -> Multiple master data (specific to environmnet) - Use API (master) - this will return
        master data -> Faker

        3. Purchase Order (state based flow applications - API) -> generate valid data -> Next Automation
